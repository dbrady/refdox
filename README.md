# Refdox - Reference Documents I Want Everywhere I Go

This is a repository for cheatsheets, reference documentation, notes to myself,
etc, that I always want no matter what machine I'm on and don't mind having be
public.

NOTE TO SELF: clone this into ~/Documents/refdox.

## This is NOT the place for...

This is NOT the place for sensitive, personal, or company private information!
Stuff You will NOT find personal/doxxable information, health-tracking
spreadsheets, or cheatsheets/notes for company-specific systems!

## What IS In Here
This list will probably fall out of date immediately but here you go:

* `til.md` - Today I Learned. Random one-liners and quick notes for all those
  things I always forget. Think of it as the world's smallest knowledgebase of
  obvious things I forget because I don't use them often enough
* `gems_i_always_want.txt` - what it says. After updating to a new ruby version,
  I probably want to do `cat gems_i_always_want.txt | xargs gem install`
* `http_statuses.txt` - A short list of every HTTP status code and its proper
  name
* `http_statuses.org` - The same list but includes notes and details, e.g. why
  you should probably never send a 302 status
