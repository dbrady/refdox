# 2 Truths and a Lie

So... there's a reason I like this game. You guys know a bit about how I see the
world a bit... differently... and I will sometimes do something dumb just
because I know it will make an awesome story later. I usually ringer this game
by telling 3 truths and no lies, but I haven't gotten to tell a real whopper in
a while, so... I am going to give you guys FIVE truths and one lie.

I will say this: the lie is not a BS "technically false" lie, it's a wildly
false statement. Like if I say I once smuggled 3 keys of cocaine through airport
security in my underwear, I'm not going to say "no, it was actually 4 keys" or
"no, it was actually heroin" or "no, it was in my sock". The lie is really a
lie

Also, here's a practice one.

* I once walked into a bank wearing a mask, told the guard I had a gun, and
  walked out with $6000 that was not legally withdrawn from my account or
  anybody else's.

...or how about 5 truths and a lie, heh.

1. I have knowingly smuggled illegal drugs into the United States from Mexico.
2. I once held a top-secret security clearance in spite of spending two years in
   juvenile detention (for something else on this list that was later expunged).
3. I learned to pick locks and crawl through air vents in middle school because
   even back then I knew that sneaking into the computer lab was better than
   being out on the streets.
4. I have stolen tens of thousands of dollars worth of munitions from the TOCDEF
   (Tooele Chemical Weapons Destruction Facility). (It's okay, I gave them back.)
5. I once gained physical access to the Salt Lake City mayor's server in the
   middle of the night. I gained root, wrote some harmless code and compiled it
   just to see if I could, then found their document storage server and
   formatted its disks.
6. I once snuck a knife through airport security by throwing it over the metal
   detector, walking through it, and catching the knife on the other side.
